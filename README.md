# Nish — Training Log (v3)

New features added:
- **RPE per set** (1–10)
- **Rest Timer** (60/90/120/custom)
- **Editable Categories** with colors (Push/Pull/Legs presets included)
- **Inline Edit/Delete** directly from the History page
- Tabs fixed + colorful UI

## Update your live site
Replace your hosted files with these four:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `README.md`

Then redeploy (push to GitHub Pages or drop the folder to Netlify).

## Notes
- Data is still in `localStorage`. Use **Export** regularly if you switch devices.
- Editing a workout: click **Edit** in History → it loads into **Log Workout** → make changes → click **Update Workout**.
